Project overview
	This project will be divided into time periods of two semesters, indicated by the course definitions E_E 415 and E_E 416.  The goal by the end of this year is to have a working real time processing system that takes data from the ultrasonic transducer acting on a wood panel and performs a signal analysis of the waveforms.  

E_E 415
	By the time this semester is over, we are to have a working prototype that can be showcased on a poster.  This elements of this part of the project are outlined below.
 - Raw data is continuously read by the field programmable gate array (FPGA)
 - Ordered data is bussed to a linux system within the FPGA
 - Registered waveforms are processed and transmitted through ethernet to a computer
 - Processed data is developed into a user interface (UI)


**Elements of the project will be updated as progress is made throughout the semester**
